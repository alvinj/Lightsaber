Lightsaber
==========

Lightsaber is a free, open source application for Mac OS X systems that plays "lightsaber" sound effects as you move your mouse. Once Lightsaber is running, you can switch to any other application, and Lightsaber will play the sound effects when you move your mouse.

Note: Lightsaber has been tested on Mac OS X 10.9 (“Mavericks”) and 10.10 (“Yosemite”) systems. (It may also run on OS X 10.7 and 10.8, but I don’t have any computers running those older operating systems, so I can’t verify that at this time.)


Using Lightsaber
----------------

After a short initial setup process (described below), using Lightsaber is as easy as it gets. 
Just (a) start the application, (b) move your mouse, and (c) hear sound effects.

Note: While Lightsaber is packaged as a Mac application, and you can put the app icon in the 
Mac Dock as usual, the current version of Lightsaber does not have a user interface. That being
said, you can quit it in the usual ways, i.e., pressing [Command][Q] when it's the foreground
application, using the menu to quit it, or by right-clicking it in the Mac Dock and selecting
"Quit" from there.
